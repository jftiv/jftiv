- 👋 Hi, I’m @jftiv
- 👀 I’m interested in building functional websites as a hobby. I enjoy learning new languages and dissecting what makes them different and learning the benefits of different languages. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to set up front-end and back-end of websites using javascript and javascript related frameworks like React. I am currently exploring data visualization packages such as Chart.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything listed publically on my github. I would love any free advice and welcome any collaboration. 
- 📫 How to reach me: wiredco@gmail.com or theroyale#4227 on discord
