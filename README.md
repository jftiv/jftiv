- 👋 Hi, I’m @jftiv
- 👀 I am interested in exploring new frameworks and building new projects to test them. I am currently working as a SDET doing QA and automation.
- 🌱 I am currently exploring new frameworks for frontend and backend JS. Previously I have worked with react and express but I would like to explore new frameworks such as nextjs to see how serverside rendering can improve the pipeline. While working on this I am looking to expand my knowledge with unit and integration tests by building out my personal projects testing frameworks. I am currently looking to improve my knowledge of Cypress and hope to expand into Jest and WebdriverIO. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything listed publically on my github. I would love any advice and welcome any collaboration on anything including projects I've currently hidden from my github but are shown on my homepage. 
- 📫 How to reach me: wiredco@gmail.com or theroyale#4227 on discord
